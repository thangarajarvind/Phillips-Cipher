# Phillips Cipher

This project implements the encryption and decryption of the Phillips Cipher from scratch using Python. The Phillips Cipher is a block cipher that uses a 5x5 matrix for the substitution of characters in blocks of five. The encryption and decryption processes involve rearranging rows in the matrix and applying offset shifts to encode or decode the text.
## Features offered

- Matrix Formation: Create a 5x5 matrix based on user input.
- Encryption:
    - Process plain text by removing punctuation and the least occurring character.
    - Separate the text into blocks of five characters, padding if necessary.
    - Apply the Phillips Cipher algorithm to generate cipher text.
- Decryption:
    - Process cipher text and separate it into blocks of five characters.
    - Apply the reverse Phillips Cipher algorithm to retrieve the original plain text.
